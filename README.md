## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Data Science internship project at CodeClause. The project focuses on developing a churn prediction model using Logistic Regression for the telecom industry. The goal is to leverage customer data to identify and anticipate customer churn patterns, contributing to improved customer retention strategies.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can effectively predict customer churn in the telecom industry. By analyzing historical customer data, we aim to build a Logistic Regression model that can identify potential churn patterns and help the telecom company take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Steps
Step 1: 

Import the necessary libraries
In this step, we import the required Python libraries that will be used throughout the project for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

Step 2: 

Importing and Merging Datasets
Here, we load and merge the relevant datasets containing customer information and churn data. This merged dataset will be the foundation for our analysis.

Step 3: 

Data Cleaning & Transformation
In this step, we perform data cleaning and transformation tasks, which include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Step 4: 

Data Visualization
We create visualizations to gain insights into the data. This step helps us understand the distribution of features, correlations, and potential patterns related to customer churn.

Step 5: 

Model Building and Analysis
The core of the project, this step involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, building a Logistic Regression model, training it on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the testing set.

## Results
The results of the churn prediction model are presented in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are discussed, along with the interpretation of coefficients from the Logistic Regression model.

## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully developed a churn prediction model using Logistic Regression for the telecom industry. The insights gained from the model can assist the telecom company in identifying customers at risk of churning and implementing targeted retention strategies.
